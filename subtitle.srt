00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,831
Hey, you!

2
00:01:01,204 --> 00:01:04,105
Got to get off or pay
for the return trip.
We're at the beach.

3
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,399
I've got to meet somebody.

4
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:09,841
I got to stay here
until he gets here.

5
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:11,741
Don't make me throw you off.

[Harry choking]

10
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:29,285
Bye, Mr. Butler. That's right.

11
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:31,015
Yeah.

12
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:32,760
Beautiful.

13
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:35,929
Just relax.

14
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:38,097
Oh, yeah.

15
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:40,200
Yeah.

16
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:48,239
You did me good, Mr. Butler.

17
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:50,941
Just right.

18
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,445
Everything is gonna be
all right now.

19
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:14,665
Some of these cases
are still "possibles."

20
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:18,173
I don't have enough time
to talk to the people listed
on the AR reports.

21
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:19,731
I don't like it better
than you do...

22
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:22,744
but we don't have time to
screw around on dead-enders.

23
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:23,938
Okay.

24
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:27,210
How about this prosti
Janet Nicolas. You got
anything good on that one?

25
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:30,013
At first we thought that
the pimp was good for it...

26
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:31,883
but he's got an alibi
that won't quit.

27
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:33,320
Maybe it's a john.
I don't know.

28
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:34,447
Dump it.

29
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:37,982
How about this wino they found
under the pier? Butler.
What's with him?

30
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:40,289
That looks like a mugging,
except for one thing.

31
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:44,424
He had a pretty good bauble
on his finger. A wedding ring
with a half-karat stone.

32
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,195
We had it appraised for $200.

33
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,794
Some diamond. Probably
wouldn't scratch glass.

34
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:53,274
I got a hunch it's more than
a mugging. Let me hold onto
it for a couple more days.

35
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:55,106
You got anything solid?

36
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:56,577
I got a feeling.
I got a hunch.

37
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:57,670
Dump it.

38
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:50,563
(Rocky)
I settled up with Mort.

39
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:52,828
He's got the cabin all stocked
with Scotch.

40
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:55,935
We could really have
ourselves a hoot, Son.

41
00:04:57,306 --> 00:05:01,140
What have you got that's
so important, you can't go
fishing with your old man?

42
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,871
I ain't been a good father
or something?

43
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:04,970
Come on, Rocky,
don't get personal.

44
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,178
You're broke, right?

45
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,349
You should have took
over my rig, Jimmy.

46
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,752
You would have made
a heck of a good trucker.

47
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:15,949
But no, you got to be
Sam Spade or something.

48
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,255
You're a vicious old coot.

49
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,165
Ten bucks says
it's a bill collector.

50
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,876
Make it 20,
plus welching privileges.

51
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:45,913
Are you James Rockford?

52
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:46,977
Yes I am.

53
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:49,786
My name is Sara Butler.
I'd like to speak
with you, if I may.

54
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:51,486
Sure. Come in.

55
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:54,928
I bet you're that Miss Butler
from the bank, right?

56
00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:56,328
I beg your pardon.

57
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,799
This is my father,
Joseph Rockford.

58
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:00,426
How do you do?

59
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:06,505
Is this your office?

60
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:09,710
Yeah, it's cheap,
it's tax deductible,
earthquake-proof...

61
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,441
and when I get a job out
of town, I take it with me.

62
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:15,049
I'd like to hire you,
Mr. Rockford.

63
00:06:16,986 --> 00:06:20,114
I'll be at Mort's cabin.

And don't forget
the welching privileges.

00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,190
I won't.

67
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,368
Nice to have met you.

68
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:40,372
He's lost a bet. I gave him
the right to renegotiate
the loss.

69
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,911
He'd get me drunk and we'll
settle for five bucks.

70
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:43,877
You want a cup of coffee?

71
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,436
No, thank you.

72
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:48,274
I hope you can afford me.

73
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:50,243
I'm sorry. What?

74
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:53,250
I like to get the business
out of the way up front.

75
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:57,292
I don't want to shock you,
Miss Butler, but I cost $200
a day, plus expenses.

76
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,822
Two hundred dollars?

77
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:00,157
Plus expenses.

78
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:03,688
And I only handle
criminal cases
that are closed.

79
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:06,826
I get myself messed up
in a LAPD active file...

80
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:08,302
I get my can shot off.

81
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:12,000
Tell me how you got
this wonderful finishing
school approach, Mr. Rockford?

82
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:16,276
People come to me all the time
and they all have problems.

83
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:19,610
Sit down. I used to be
softhearted
and I'd sit and listen.

84
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,513
But they couldn't
pay the freight.

85
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:25,076
So they'd leave
and be all depressed...

86
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,416
and I'd be depressed...

87
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:29,686
and it was turning me off
my own business,
so now I do it this way.

88
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:32,217
If $200 is the price,
that's fine.

89
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:34,763
Money doesn't happen to be
my particular problem.

90
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:38,362
I have enough money to hire
a platoon of people like you.

91
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,764
That's Rockford with a "k."

92
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:48,971
Now, may I assume
I have your attention?

93
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,480
What is it that I can do
for you, Miss Butler?

94
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:55,176
My father was murdered.

95
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:57,515
The police don't seem to think
it was very important.

96
00:07:57,587 --> 00:07:59,179
Just a skid row killing.

97
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:01,820
Skid row?

98
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,225
My father was a wino.

99
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:08,129
Two years ago, my mother died.

100
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,893
After she died, it seemed
to be all over for him.

101
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:15,461
I tried to make him forget,
but he started drinking
and ended up a bum.

102
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,502
Two months ago
somebody killed him...

103
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:19,837
and nobody seems to care
who did it but me.

104
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,238
Aren't the police on it?

105
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:25,610
There was a Detective Becker
working on it,
but they closed the case...

106
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:27,410
so he recommended
I come to you.

107
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:31,980
If homicide can't solve it,
there's a pretty good chance
I can't, either.

108
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:34,987
I've just learned something
that I think changes that.

109
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:36,524
Did you tell the police?

110
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:39,254
Yes, but they still
don't think there's anything
they can do.

111
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:41,629
What is it?

112
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:44,298
I'd like you to meet
my brother. He can tell you.

113
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:47,225
Could you wait outside,
Miss Butler?

114
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,601
I'd like to make a phone call.

115
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:51,701
Does that mean
you'll take the case?

116
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:55,403
We'll talk to your brother
first, then I'll let you know.
I'll be right out.

117
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:11,992
I'd like to run a credit check
on a Miss Sara Butler.

118
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:16,355
Now that's dumb, Sara.
I mean,
that's just plain dumb.

119
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:20,334
I don't want to talk to you,
mister, so you and my sister
can just take a hike.

120
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,370
I'm not talking to anybody
about my father.

121
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,837
He was just a drunk.

122
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:27,936
The hell with him.

123
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:32,844
He treated you like a queen.

124
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:35,383
Bought you presents,
told you how pretty you were.

125
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,816
I got to carry his golf bags
on Saturday
and take out the garbage.

126
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:41,579
So you go ahead, Sara,
you have sympathy.

127
00:09:41,657 --> 00:09:44,217
But sympathy is an emotion
that's counterproductive.

128
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,558
Would you rather I take
Mr. Rockford to meet
your Mrs. Elias?

129
00:09:49,031 --> 00:09:50,362
You wouldn't.

130
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:53,027
Come on, Mr. Rockford.
There's someone
I'd like you to meet.

131
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:54,831
Sara, wait a minute.
You can't do this.

132
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:55,928
Watch me.

133
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:00,408
You're a cop, huh?

134
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:04,572
No. What I am, sonny, is about
50 pounds heavier and one hell
of a lot meaner.

135
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,639
So you better straighten up
your act.
I don't think I like you.

136
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:12,386
Yeah, okay.

137
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:16,884
But just don't bother
Mrs. Elias. I mean,
it's not even important.

138
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,892
Sara thinks it's a big deal,
but it's not.

139
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:20,758
Tell me about it anyway.

140
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,061
This lady that I make
deliveries to got
kind of interested in me.

141
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:28,160
She heard about
my mother dying
and my father getting killed.

142
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:31,172
She found out that I wanted
to be a doctor. That's all.

143
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,533
That's not all, Nick.
Tell him everything.

144
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:37,844
She's offered to put me
through medical school.

145
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:40,506
That's all?

146
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,414
I told you it wasn't much.

147
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:45,386
Will you tell him the rest?

148
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:49,649
She orders her pharmaceuticals
from this drugstore...

149
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:51,716
and has them delivered
to her house in Bel Air.

150
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:52,761
You see?

151
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:53,886
No.

152
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:57,421
Why would she deal with
this drugstore? There's 15
or 20 that are closer to her.

153
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,333
She just does. Sara,
don't blow this for me.

154
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:03,702
How many times does a guy
get a chance to be

155
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:05,468
Don't mess it up.

156
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:09,141
The medical profession needs
more sweet guys like you.

00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:40,632
What's wrong?

161
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,575
I was just beginning
to like you.

162
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:45,238
I like you, too.

163
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:48,210
While we were out slapping
your brother around...

164
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:51,014
I had somebody run
a credit check on you.

165
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,144
Guess what I found out?

166
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:53,449
What?

167
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:56,621
You laid
some bad paper on me.

168
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:00,762
People who like each other
hardly ever do
that sort of thing.

169
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,298
How stupid of me.
That's my household account.

170
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:05,230
I'm sorry. I wrote it
on the wrong bank

171
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:06,427
Knock it off, Sara.

172
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:10,302
These guys tell me that you're
the only one in town
with worse credit than me.

173
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:14,370
I had to do that.

174
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:18,141
This is important to me.
He was my father.

175
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:20,910
Somebody killed him.
They choked him
with a necktie.

176
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:22,917
They took his shoes
and left him on the beach.

177
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:26,580
They're not gonna get away
with it. Not if I have
anything to say about it.

178
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:30,415
I'm sorry about that check
but nobody would listen to me.

179
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:34,657
Will you please take
this case, Mr. Rockford?

180
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:37,465
Don't you see
how strange it is?

181
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:40,468
Why would she deal
with that pharmacy?
It doesn't make sense.

182
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:43,027
What's that got to do
with your father's death?

183
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:46,074
I don't know,
but it is strange, isn't it?
Admit that.

184
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:49,639
All right, it's strange,
but it's not that strange.

185
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:52,178
Now that you've seen Nick,
how many women do you think...

186
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:54,739
would be interested
in sending him
to medical school?

187
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,776
But we haven't seen
Mrs. Elias yet.

188
00:12:57,853 --> 00:13:00,651
She may look like she got
dredged up out
of the LA river.

189
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:03,283
Nick says Mrs. Elias
is very attractive.

190
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:10,187
All right, Sara. I say
that is a little odd, but...

191
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,567
it's still pretty thin.

192
00:13:13,636 --> 00:13:16,002
I don't see how
I can help you.

193
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:19,366
What is it with you?
Are you
independently wealthy...

194
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:21,238
or just on some kind of
big case or something?

195
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,746
What do you do for a living
when you're not
writing bad checks?

196
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:26,108
I have a small bikini shop.

197
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,614
How much do you make?

198
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,378
Two hundred a week
after expenses.

199
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:30,611
So you really can't
afford me.

200
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:31,812
No.

201
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,050
If I don't think
I can solve this case...

202
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:37,615
and I go ahead
and take everything
you make in one week...

203
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,890
for one day of my time,
what does that make me?

204
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,857
I don't think
that's your problem.

205
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:45,196
I think it makes me
an unprincipled jerk.

206
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:49,135
Since I don't have any real
close friends, I have to
get along with myself.

207
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:53,000
So I don't take cases
where I think I'm wasting
my time or your money.

208
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:55,568
If you had any.

209
00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:02,140
Wait a minute.
What are you doing
for dinner tonight?

210
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:03,308
What?

211
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:07,219
I know this restaurant out
in the Valley. It's really
very lovely. If you're free

212
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:09,120
Sara, don't do that.

213
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,828
All right I'll look into it
for an hour or so,
just for fun. No charge.

214
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,521
If it looks like it's gonna
develop, I'll take it on.

215
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,726
Good.

216
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:25,105
Here. Don't drop it.
It may bounce up
and hit you in the chin.

217
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:29,000
Funny, very funny.

218
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:42,213
I don't know, Jimmy.
Go figure.

219
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,085
If I didn't have to
keep this job, I'd quit.

220
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,491
So quit.

221
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,360
You don't know what it's like
being on parole.

222

by the Governor. But me...

223

with some fish
called Norman Carter...

224
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,462

how it's going.

225
00:14:57,673 --> 00:15:01,234

own this paper, I'd never have
gotten out of prison.

226
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,336
No, I'm stuck, baby.
I'm stuck.

228
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:09,009
Yeah, well,
I probably had it coming.

229
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,519
I did that bank job.

230
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,716
Yeah?

231
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:19,858
When we were in prison,
you must have told me
100 times you were innocent.

232
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:21,225
Well, I wasn't.

233
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:24,563
How about you?
Did you do that thing?

234
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:27,130
No, I was bad-rapped.

235
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,235
Sure.

236
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:36,534
Look, I told you.
Come on, be straight with me.

237

some old society columns...

I can't.
It's a condition of parole.

I can't hang around with
anybody I did time with.

anybody. What the hell?

All right...

to be about it, I didn't do
the bank job, either.

at the file, will you?

307
00:19:13,662 --> 00:19:15,596
Are you sure
that's what you want to do?

308
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,828
Okay, we got a deal.

309
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:25,403
Why did you take it?

310
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:29,901
I looked into
Mrs. Elias's background.
I found something strange.

311
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:33,546
Three years ago,
she was a dancer here in LA.

312
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:35,606
Did a lot
of TV variety shows.

313
00:19:35,684 --> 00:19:36,776
Why is that strange?

314
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,480
She married a man
by the name of William Elias.

315
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,921
Mr. Elias was 68 years old...

316
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:45,619
and looked like he'd been
dumped out
of a vacuum cleaner.

317
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,093
But he had $10 million.

318
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:52,363
So they were married
in Las Vegas and on their
wedding night, he croaked.

319
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:57,370
But I don't see how that ties
in with my father's death?

320
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,667
I don't either.

321
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:02,266
It didn't even happen
within 10 months of when
your father was killed.

322
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:04,839
But Nick's
medical school offer...

323
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,939
that's also strange,
and I don't like coincidences.

324
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:10,348
So, I'll look into it
for a day or so.

325
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,011
Thank you, Mr. Rockford.

326
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,352
My father is Mr. Rockford.
I'm Jim.

327
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:19,285
Thank you, Jim.

328
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,750
I don't mind telling you
that his widow, Mrs. Elias...

329
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:45,878
was treated very badly
by the authorities.

330
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:49,285
They felt she had killed him
because of the amount
of money involved...

331
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:51,826
and also because
she was 30 years younger.

332
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,860
The fact that he died
on their wedding night.

333
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:55,556
That all sounds
pretty reasonable.

334
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,566
Maybe, but you should have
seen his respiratory system.

335
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:03,236
His arteries were hard enough
to pound through two inches
of concrete.

336
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:08,600
There is no way it could have
been induced by electric shock
or drugs or something?

337
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:11,202
No. As I said, Mr. Rockford...

338
00:21:11,413 --> 00:21:15,144
Mr. Elias had a cousin
who was trying to cut himself
into the will.

339
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,014
He had four different doctors
examine the body after I did.

340
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:20,077
They all came
to the same conclusion.

341
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,682
Mr. Elias died of
a very natural
and inevitable heart attack.

342
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,358
Thank you.

343
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,352
Mr. Rockford?

344
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:33,433
Are you planning
to reopen the case?

345
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:37,904
Because if you are
and you're interested
in a medical opinion...

346
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:39,440
you're wasting your time.

347

for seeing me, Doctor.

I don't know whether you
remember me,
but this is Dr. Seelman.

Yes, of course
I remember, Doctor.

353
00:22:08,737 --> 00:22:11,001
You did the autopsy
on William.

354

I didn't want to bother you,
but there is a man up here...

355
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:17,339
who seems quite interested
in the coroner's report
I filed.

356
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,547
How strange.

357
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:23,615
I felt very badly
about the way you were treated
when your husband died.

358
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:28,149
Thank you, Doctor.
You wouldn't happen
to have his name?

359
00:22:28,523 --> 00:22:32,050
Yes I do. I have his card.

361

It says that he's a
private investigator who
specializes in closed cases.

362
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,862
There's no address
on the card.

363
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,862
I see. Thank you
very much, Doctor.

364
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:48,575
Mrs. Elias...

365

if you ever get up
to Las Vegas...

366
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:55,107
I hope we might
see each other.

367
00:22:55,383 --> 00:22:58,375
Yes, of course, Dr. Seelman.
I still have your number.

368
00:22:58,453 --> 00:23:02,685
Let's make a date
and plan on it.
Could I call you back later?

Hello, Jerry, it's Milly.

I was just about to call you.
Where's this week's check?

379
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:35,887
Forget the check.
It'll be there.
I've got to see you.

380
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:38,450
I think we're in trouble.

Hi.

382
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:55,535
Hi.

383
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:58,638
I just got back from Vegas.

384
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:03,113
The coroner who did the
autopsy says, that Mr. Elias
died of a heart attack.

385
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:07,144
He swears it's legit.
There is no possibility
it was induced.

386
00:24:07,222 --> 00:24:11,090
If there was some connection
between my father and
Mr. Elias, maybe he's lying.

387
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,148
Why?

388
00:24:12,227 --> 00:24:13,489
Maybe she paid him.

389
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:16,320
There were four other
doctors involved.

390
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,197
If you want my opinion,
it's a dead end.

391
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:22,134
Does that mean
you're off the case again?

392
00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:27,770
I didn't charge you for
the time, 10 hours, driving up
to Vegas and back.

393
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,139
I just...

394
00:24:29,744 --> 00:24:31,735
put in seven cents
a mile and the gas...

395
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:35,715
and the time I spent working
on it up there
and the two phone calls here.

396
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:39,176
It comes to $75.
It's tax deductible.
This is your receipt.

397
00:24:39,454 --> 00:24:41,615
What kind of a jerk are you?

who killed your father,
but...

If you wanna take the advice
of a friend, forget it.

Even if you find out
who killed him...

403
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,241
he'll still be dead and you
won't feel any better
about it. Believe me.

You don't know
anything about it.

your seven cents a mile

and you're trying to tell me
about my father.

407

I'm going to find out
who killed him.

one other thing

out you're overdrawn

I might take a look
at Mrs. Elias.

If she's sending
eight other guys

of admissions is quite
a challenging job.

432

Most people
don't realize it, but...

433
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:52,199
at Mollar we have at least
1,200 applications
for every opening.

434
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:54,240

Most of those
are multiple applications.

438
00:29:02,217 --> 00:29:06,745
That means they are people
who are also applying
to other medical schools.

439

at Mollar.

Yes, almost.

if you could set up

to guarantee
the full four years.

454

Believe me, it's not that we
don't trust your word...

455
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:09,177
it's just that we have to have
certain guarantees.

to wake up and catch us.

608
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,896
Why? Are you afraid of him?
You're damn right I am.

609
00:46:37,971 --> 00:46:40,064
Look through
those drawers there.

610
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:43,876
What are we looking for?
We'll know when we find it.

[Drawers opening]

612
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,786
What's that?

613
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:56,379
Those are losing tickets
at the track.

614
00:46:56,456 --> 00:47:00,688
Some big-time gambler
we got here.
He saves his old tickets.

615
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:27,882
Did you find something?
Yeah, his trophy case.

616
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:34,488
We made one nice connection.
Who is it?

617
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,654
That's Mrs. Mildred Elias.

618
00:47:38,098 --> 00:47:41,226
Yeah, here it is.
This stuff is dusty.

619
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:44,099
They tried to get me
down here at first to get
into re-filing.

620
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:47,106
I told them it took me
half an hour to find a name
in the phone book.

621
00:47:47,174 --> 00:47:49,540
Sara, could I have a picture
of your father, please?

622
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:53,103
(Angel)
You think these two guys
are mixed up together?

623
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,115
Police buried the wrong one?
(Rockford)
No, they died 10 months apart.

624
00:47:56,183 --> 00:47:59,675
Mr. Elias had an
open-casket funeral
with all his friends there.

625
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:02,415
Is this all you need, Jim?
Yeah. Could I keep this,
Angel?

626
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:03,786
Sure.
Thanks.

627
00:48:04,224 --> 00:48:06,590
Me and Jimmy go way back
a long ways together.

628
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,652
We was in the pen together.
We were both framed.

629

[Door closes]

630
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:23,705
Jim, were you really
in prison?

631
00:48:24,244 --> 00:48:26,940
Does it matter?
Of course it matters.

632
00:48:29,016 --> 00:48:31,280
I spent five years
in a state pen.

633
00:48:31,885 --> 00:48:34,251
For what?
Armed robbery.

634
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:39,350
Did you do it?
Would you believe me
if I said no?

635
00:48:40,861 --> 00:48:42,385
Probably not.

636
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:44,592
Then let's don't mess with it.

637
00:48:45,399 --> 00:48:47,993
I'm sorry, Jim.
That was really mean.

638
00:48:48,535 --> 00:48:51,663
If you told me you were
innocent, I'd believe you.
I really would.

639
00:48:51,938 --> 00:48:55,897
It's not important
to me anymore. It used to be.

640
00:48:57,244 --> 00:49:00,145
I wanted everybody
to know I was innocent.

641
00:49:01,214 --> 00:49:03,774
The Governor gave me a pardon,
said it never happened.

642
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:07,809
I took that pardon and
I had it framed and I put it
up on the wall in my office.

643
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:14,250
Then one day I looked at it...

644
00:49:17,064 --> 00:49:21,194
and suddenly it wasn't
important anymore,
so I took it down.

645
00:49:23,036 --> 00:49:25,630
And you think I ought to
take my father's picture down?

646
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,966
I won't tell you
what to do, Sara.

647
00:49:28,141 --> 00:49:30,837
I gave up that habit
while I was in prison.

648
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:34,472
That's one of the more
constructive things I learned
while I was there.

649
00:49:35,415 --> 00:49:38,475
Somebody killed him
and whoever it is
ought to be caught.

650
00:49:38,885 --> 00:49:41,285
The trick is not to
get caught yourself.

651
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:44,252
You're talking to an expert.

652
00:49:45,058 --> 00:49:47,686
I spent five years
of my life in that trap.

653
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,320
It's hard to climb out.

654
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:57,332
You're a sentimentalist.
How strange.

655
00:49:59,473 --> 00:50:00,906
Not really.

656
00:50:20,093 --> 00:50:23,085
I'll catch a plane for Vegas
in the morning
and call you then.

657
00:50:23,263 --> 00:50:24,628
It's gonna cost you, sweets.

658
00:50:24,698 --> 00:50:27,394
I know it's gonna cost.
You just get the plane.

659
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:30,828
It'll run you $10,000.
That includes everything.

660
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:33,272
Okay, stay handy.

661
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,036

664

What are you gonna do,
kill somebody else?

No, I won't shut up.

about that old man, Butler.

of any more killings.

to kill someone.

we're not gonna kill anybody.

a little and then
buy them off.

Give me the money.

I'll have to get it
in the morning.

Sara?

689
00:52:20,914 --> 00:52:24,816
I want you to tell me
about your father.
The last year or so.

690
00:52:25,952 --> 00:52:29,649
There's some connection
between your father
and the late Mr. Elias.

691
00:52:30,657 --> 00:52:32,022
We have to find it.

692
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,260
There's not much to tell,
really.

693
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:39,595
He used to be an
advertising account executive
and then after mother died...

694
00:52:40,233 --> 00:52:41,825
he just went downhill.

695
00:52:42,936 --> 00:52:45,234
I used to go to skid row
and try and bring him home...

696
00:52:45,305 --> 00:52:48,706
but it never did any good.
All he ever wanted to do
was drink.

697
00:52:51,778 --> 00:52:55,874
One time I couldn't find him
for three weeks and I was
afraid that he was dead...

698
00:52:55,949 --> 00:52:58,315
and that they'd buried him
and I'd never know where.

699
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:02,484
So I took time off from
my work to look for him and
then I couldn't find him.

700
00:53:03,657 --> 00:53:06,148
One day I was in
St. Anne's Mission
and I looked up...

701
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:08,387
and there he was
and he was so drunk...

702
00:53:08,762 --> 00:53:11,526
So I took him out
and I fed him and I asked him
where he'd been.

703
00:53:11,598 --> 00:53:14,158
He said he'd been
to the desert for his health.

704
00:53:14,634 --> 00:53:17,467
And then another time...
When was that?
What was the date?

705
00:53:19,606 --> 00:53:23,508
It was sometime last year.
I can't remember.

706
00:53:25,478 --> 00:53:27,309
I think I know when it was.

707
00:53:28,682 --> 00:53:30,650
It was the first two weeks
in June.

708
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:37,621
That's right.
That is when it was.
How did you know?

709
00:53:37,691 --> 00:53:39,716
Come on, let's get going.
Where are we going?

710
00:53:39,793 --> 00:53:42,591
Pick up something at my place,
make a phone call.
We're going to Vegas.

711
00:53:42,662 --> 00:53:44,755
Come on, get going. For what?
Get dressed.

712
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,889

Hi, Rocky. It's me.

716
00:54:00,714 --> 00:54:04,013
Hey, Jimmy, you gonna
get up here after all?

717
00:54:04,918 --> 00:54:06,146
No. I need some help.

718
00:54:06,686 --> 00:54:09,484
I'll help you bait a hook
if you can get up here.

They're really biting, Jimmy.

in the City Administrator's
office in Las Vegas?

721
00:54:15,762 --> 00:54:16,751
Yeah.

722
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:20,266
I have to get into City Hall
in Las Vegas tonight.

723
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,166
Can't do it, Jimmy.
Why not?

724
00:54:23,837 --> 00:54:26,931
He lives in a trailer park
and he ain't got no phone.

725
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:29,305
Trailer park?
What are you talking about?

726
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:34,237
Well, he ain't exactly
a City Administrator.

727
00:54:34,848 --> 00:54:35,837
But you said...

728
00:54:35,915 --> 00:54:39,282
I know what I said,
but I was exaggerating
a little.

729
00:54:39,753 --> 00:54:43,450
Is he an Assistant
City Administrator?
No.

730
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,489
Just what is he, Dad?

731
00:54:46,726 --> 00:54:50,287
He's a janitor in the
City Administrator's office.

732
00:54:51,564 --> 00:54:56,001
You're some kind of a liar.
I wasn't lying.
I wouldn't lie, Jimmy.

733
00:54:56,536 --> 00:54:57,594
Now, think about it.

734
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:02,198
What I said was that he was
cleaning up in the
City Administrator's office.

735
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:05,038
That's what I said.

736
00:55:06,212 --> 00:55:09,375
Rocky, does he have
a set of keys?
Can he get me into City Hall?

737
00:55:09,949 --> 00:55:11,940
I don't know. It's Saturday.

738
00:55:12,085 --> 00:55:15,543
I'll pay you $50,
plus welching privileges.

739

Jim, you're not in
any trouble, are you?
No, Dad, I'm okay.

00:55:23,163 --> 00:55:27,429
Okay, I'll see you
in five hours.
Right.

00:55:32,972 --> 00:55:35,133
What's that?
That's my gat.

742
00:55:37,077 --> 00:55:39,739
You mean you didn't have a gun
on when I picked up Jerry?

743
00:55:39,813 --> 00:55:41,041
No, why?

744
00:55:42,015 --> 00:55:44,006
What if he'd tried to rape me
or something?

745
00:55:45,018 --> 00:55:46,781
He wouldn't do
a thing like that.

746
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:51,246

a permit to carry a gun.

it might explain everything.

00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:18,350
for Mr. And
Mrs. William Elias?
It was June of last year.

757
00:56:19,352 --> 00:56:22,219
Pretty important,
to get us up at 6:00 a. M?

758
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:24,390
It is.
How important?

759
00:56:26,259 --> 00:56:30,389
I didn't say anything to him.
It'll come out
of your end, Rocky.

thy troth to her
in all love and honor?

763
00:57:20,346 --> 00:57:24,305
In all duty and service.
In all faith and tenderness.

I require him now
to make it known...

or ever after
to hold his peace.

Louis Delgado,
wilt thou have this woman
to be thy wife?

00:57:40,433 --> 00:57:41,422
(Louis)
I will.

768
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:51,605
I figure it's this next street
up here, but I can't tell.

Look at your map.

I looked at the map
but I can't figure it out.

Yes.

Mildred and her
$10 million bridegroom

left the wedding party
in LA.

01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:34,849
They flew to Vegas,
checked into a motel
and then old man Elias died.

Before the wedding?
You've got the rest of it
figured out?

Yeah.

She calls Jerry Grimes
and tells him
she just lost $10 million.

Jerry says, "Did you
sign all the papers...

Your father hangs around
Vegas for a while.

he sobers up long enough...

to figure out that Mrs. Elias
inherited $10 million.

I mean,
he wouldn't blackmail them.

caught them. I...
